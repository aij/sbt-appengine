## sbt-appengine + sbt-revolver = hot reloading dev server

One glaring omission in [sbt-appengine][1] when it was ported from [@Yasushi][1]'s [sbt-appengine-plugin][3] was the ability to run development server locally from sbt shell.

sbt-appengine 0.4.0 now adds `appengine-dev-server` task that runs development server in a forked vm managed using sbt-revolver. This allows triggered redeployment:

    > ~ appengine-dev-server

But wait there's more. By installing [JRebel][4] (there's a free Scala license) and setting the path as:

    export JREBEL_PATH=/Applications/ZeroTurnaround/JRebel/jrebel.jar

development server is run under JRebel. This allows hot reloading:

    > appengine-dev-server
    > ~ package-war

You change your code, and it reflects to http://localhost:8080/ automatically. This feature was implemented by [@philcali][philcali] and [@eed3si9n][eed3si9n].

## how to install

The use of sbt-revolver requires an additional resolver in `plugins.sbt`:

    addSbtPlugin("com.eed3si9n" % "sbt-appengine" % "0.4.0")

    resolvers ++= Seq(
      "spray repo" at "http://repo.spray.cc",
      Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-releases",
        url("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases/"))(Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)
    )
